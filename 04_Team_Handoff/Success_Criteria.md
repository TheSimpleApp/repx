SELECT 
  company_id,
  COUNT(*) as total_reps,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN retention_status = 'active' THEN 1 END) as active_reps,
  ROUND(
    COUNT(CASE WHEN retention_status = 'active' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 
    2
  ) as retention_percentage
FROM users 
WHERE hire_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '12 months'
GROUP BY company_id;
```

### **2. Contact Utilization Rate**
**Target**: 80% of imported contacts processed within first week
**Measurement**: Percentage of contacts swiped (categorized or skipped)

const contactStats = await db.collection('users').doc(userId).collection('contacts').get();
const totalContacts = contactStats.size;
const processedContacts = contactStats.docs.filter(doc => doc.data().isProcessed).length;
const utilizationRate = (processedContacts / totalContacts) * 100;
```

  COUNT(*) as total_reps,
  ROUND(
    COUNT(CASE WHEN first_customer_date - hire_date <= 14 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*),
