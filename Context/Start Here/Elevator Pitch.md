RepX: Elevator Pitch Worksheet
This document has been refactored to reflect the new app name, "RepX," and its core value proposition.
Step 1: Elevator Pitch Formula
My app, RepX, helps direct sales companies who struggle with slow, expensive recruiting and high new-hire turnover by providing a system that automatically multiplies their sales force. Unlike traditional job boards and manual onboarding methods, my app uses a Tinder-like contact swiping system to turn every new hire's personal contacts into recruits and customers, while guiding them through a gamified 28-day program that increases retention from 60% to 89%.
Step 2: Define Your 3 Core Pain Points & Value Propositions
Top 3 Pain Points:
	•	Pain Point #1: Recruiting new sales reps is expensive, inconsistent, and too slow to meet growth demands.
	•	Pain Point #2: Too many new sales reps quit within the first month due to a lack of structured training, poor onboarding, and not getting early wins.
	•	Pain Point #3: Sales managers are stretched too thin; they lack the time and tools to consistently train new hires and drive recruiting efforts while also managing their own sales territory.
Top 3 Value Propositions:
	•	☑ Value Proposition #1: Turn every new rep's personal contacts into business value through our Tinder-like swiping system that identifies potential recruits and customers, eliminating expensive external recruiting costs.
	•	☑ Value Proposition #2: Achieve 89% retention rate (vs industry 60%) with a structured, gamified 28-day program that gets new reps their first customer win within 14 days, building immediate success momentum.
	•	☑ Value Proposition #3: Fully automate the onboarding process with customizable company programs, removing manager burden while delivering predictable results through systematic contact mining and structured task progression.
Step 3: Your One-Liner Summary
RepX is a mobile app that uses Tinder-like contact swiping to turn new sales reps' personal networks into recruits and customers, while delivering 89% retention through a gamified 28-day onboarding program that gets reps their first win within 14 days.
