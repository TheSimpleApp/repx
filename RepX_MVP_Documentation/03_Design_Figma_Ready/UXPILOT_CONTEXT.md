## 🎨 **Core Design Principles**

### **Pure Flat Design Philosophy**
- **NO borders, NO shadows, NO gradients** - Clean, minimal aesthetic

- **Thumb-friendly navigation** - All primary actions within thumb reach
- **Swipe-optimized interface** - Dating app-style contact categorization
- **Generous touch targets** - Minimum 44px for all interactive elements
- **Offline-first design** - Works without internet connection
- **Portrait-optimized** with field sales environment considerations
